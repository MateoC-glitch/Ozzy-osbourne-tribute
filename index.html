      <p class="lead">
        Ozzy Osbourne rose to fame in the 1970s as the frontman of the seminal
        heavy metal band Black Sabbath, delivering such iconic songs as "War
        Pigs," "Iron Man" and "Paranoid." He embarked on a successful solo
        career in 1979, earning attention for his outrageous public acts and
        drawing the ire of conservative groups. Osbourne later garnered a new
        legion of fans by starring with his family in the unlikely hit reality
        show The Osbournes.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        The former frontman for Black Sabbath started his life in a poor family
        and looked to have no prospects. Anyone who thought that has since been
        proven wrong. His father once told him that he would either end up in
        jail or go on to do something spectacular with his life, Ozzy went on to
        do both, just to cover all his bases. With the money, he received from
        his Father, the pop-culture icon bought his first mic stand, Shure
        microphone and Vox speaker that would eventually change his life. Ozzy
        has gone on to say that when he was kicked out of Black Sabbath it felt
        like another divorce, after having divorced his first wife.

        Whether you love him or hate him, Ozzy Osbourne is one of the most
        well-known and iconic figures in Heavy Metal and rock. A man that has
        gone on to conquer several types of media to bring his work into the
        lives and homes of everyone around the world.

      <h4>Media Madman</h4>
      <hr />
      <p class="lead">
        Ozzy Osbourne has been seen in the media in many different forms. From
        the music he made and performed with Black Sabbath, his successful solo
        career, in movies, sometimes biting off the head of a bat as he did in
        1982 live on stage. Additionally, he also made his way onto TV screens
        as a reality TV star in his reality show “The Osbournes” bringing his
        fame into a new era of entertainment.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h4>The Prince of Darkness</h4>
      <hr />
      <p class="lead">
        In the world of Rock, Ozzy is known as the Prince of Darkness due to his
        behaviour over the years and the persona of darkness held on stage. He
        has left an impression on the world that surpasses his musical
        contributions, which still continues to flourish. He has gone on to say
        that the day he retires, is when he hears the nails being hammered into
        his coffin. A bit dark, but fitting for the Prince of Darkness. The
        statement reigns true as Ozzy released his 12th studio album early this
        year, which he said is one of the most important albums he has ever
        made. All updates on what Ozzy has been doing can even be found on
        social media, showing that the Prince knows no bounds and is not done
        yet.
